# Hey friends! 👋

I love building things for the web but also making it look great and accessible. I help others learn web development and web design through content on [Joy of Code](https://joyofcode.xyz/) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6wpjLSLn2dhlaDjn6_V0rw). I love JavaScript and frameworks around it, so if you enjoy that type of content or need help navigating the confusing landscape of modern web develepment I'm here for you.

## ❤️ Love

- ☕️ JavaScript
- ⚛️ React
- ⚡️ Svelte
- 📜 TypeScript
